#### Provisiong Repo

A collection of the provisioning scripts I use for home and 
production.

### Ansible Scripts

Provided here are scripts for setting up a Docker Swarm, which I 
use both at home for astrophotography image manipulation and for
the production environment of my web project, commonal.ity (name
to be determined).

## To Use:
* add hosts to a host file (see gce_hosts.yml for format)
* ansible-playbook -i {hostsfile} compute.yml
